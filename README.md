Simple Chrome extension in manifest v3 that will use Claude-3 to summarize the current tab/webpage.

You will need an Anthropic API key to use this extension. Take care that the API key is currently needed in background.js until I change it to make it pull from storage.

background-debug.js is where my suggested and key debug statements were based on trouble I had making sure the contenet flowed throguh to the popup and there was readable page content.
